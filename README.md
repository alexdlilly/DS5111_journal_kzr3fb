## Module 1: Git Fundamentals

Using linux commands to navigate and inspect files is definitely something I am now comfortable with. I like using vim and find I am pretty quick with getting around directories, editing files, running scripts/makefiles etc. 

I understand what linux commands like cat, grep, and find do. I see how they're super useful in make files or running those commands within other environments (!notation in Jupyter notebooks), but I can't see myself running those commands in the CLI alone. 

Github commands like init, clone, add, commit, push I am very comfortable with. Visualizing in my head the repo branches and what it means to create a branch then merge a branch is a little more vague to me, but I feel more comfortable now after this class than I did before. 

## Module 2: Software Skills Part 1

I am comfortable with asserts - this was something I was familiar with prior to this course. I understand the usefulness of proper naming and coding conventions, and how things like pylint are useful tools to enforce those best practices. I think I could use more practice with implementing these practices, however, because some of these best practices are not the most intuitive to me. 

I had no experience with pytest prior to this course - I would just write test scripts. I can see how pytest is super useful, but if a supervisor or something asked me to draft a set of test scripts I would have to reference quite a bit of material before I would get it to work. The assignments using pytest went very smoothly though.  

## Module 3: Software Skills Part 2

I was familiar with SSH prior to this course but if you asked me to SSH to a remote machine I would have to lookup the commands/process. Now, I feel pretty comfortable with SSH - both what it is and how to do it. It was super interesting to SSH Tunnel into Jupyterlab. 

## Module 4: Software Skills Part 3

I was not at all familiar with how AWS worked prior to this course. Now, I feel pretty comfortable with establishing an instance, connecting to it, etc. The discussion in the live sessions about shells being objects, and how the instances can persist in the background despite you not being in the shell was interesting. 

## Module 5: Software Testing

Pytest and testing in general I feel much more comfortable with now. The assignment for testing where we had to implement failing assertions and conditional tests was informative. I can see why pytest is nice - the UI and sort of print statements that are returned to the command line make it easy to see which tests failed/passed/etc. I was able to get the extra credit working for this assignment as well, which was cool.

## Module 6: CICD

Super cool to see the github actions run the automated tests on check in. That is a really cool functionality. 

## Module 7: Containers

Containers like Docker makes sense to me. I think it will be solidified a bit more in my mind once we're able to get a docker container set up and running.
